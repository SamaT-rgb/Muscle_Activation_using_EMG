Project Title: ECG-based Prediction of Hip and Knee Angles  This project predicts hip and knee angles using ECG data with a Random Forest Regression model. The ECG signals are preprocessed, and the model is evaluated using MAE, MSE, and RÂ². Fit score metrics ensure accuracy in predicting joint angles for physical movements.
